// feeClassifications introduces the aggregate "fees" system account.
//
// Naming convention vs existing accounts:
//   - fee_expense (debit-normal, user)  — withdrawalOnlyClassifications — records the
//     user-side cost of a withdrawal fee as a debit against the user's account.
//   - fee_revenue (credit-normal, system) — withdrawalOnlyClassifications — records the
//     platform's revenue from withdrawal fees on the system side.
//   - fees (credit-normal, system) — THIS file — is a first-class catch-all revenue
//     account that aggregates all platform fee income (withdrawal fees, card top-up
//     fees, checkout fees, direct fee charges, etc.) in one place.  It is analogous
//     to consts.AccountClassificationFees in payments/backend.
//
// Relationship: fee_revenue and fees serve the same economic purpose but were
// coined independently.  Callers that previously used fee_revenue for withdrawal
// accounting may continue to do so.  New journal types (fee, checkout_settlement,
// card_topup) use "fees" for consistency with the payments reference catalogue.
